# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Meets Expectations**

User stories and your commentary in the readme looks good!. Please use `.md` instead of `.txt`
to format your documentation. Also, please include set-up instructions for this application.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job implementing user authentication. I very strongly recommend creating the association
between questions and responses - let me know if you'd like to pair on that!

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Nice Job on the CSS! Mentioned in the code, but I was unable to see the color picker working, no errors
in the console. If you move the color attribute to the responses table, you'd be able to show colors over
time if someone responds to the same question more than once.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

Please rename the URL for your heroku application with `heroku rename`. Also, I was unable
to produce any errors on your deployed application, but please move the `color` attribute from
your question model to its own table. Otherwise anyone can update anyone else's answer.
